# ESIM — External Structured Intent Memory

A graph-based MCP server that gives AI assistants persistent, structured memory via Neo4j.

ESIM turns any AI client that supports [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) into a system with long-term memory — structured as a typed knowledge graph with semantic search, relationship traversal, and automated diagnostics.

> **Upgrading from `esm`?** This release renames the project (ESM → ESIM) and makes two breaking schema changes. See **[MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md)**.

## How It Works

AI clients connect to ESIM via MCP (stdio transport). Every piece of knowledge is stored as a typed node in a Neo4j graph with vector embeddings for semantic search. Nodes are connected by typed relationships that encode how things relate.

```

    ↕ MCP (stdio)

    ↕
LLM API (embeddings + metadata extraction)
```

## Data Model

### Node Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Agent** | A person, team, org, or AI that acts with intent |
| **System** | A technical system — service, pipeline, datastore, host, or device (an `Agent` sub-label) |
| **Need** | A gap, requirement, or want — has a lifecycle |
| **Resource** | A capability or asset — skill, knowledge, tool, budget |
| **Constraint** | A governing force — priority, understanding, approach, mechanics |
| **Output** | Something produced by an agent |
| **Role** | A named function or position |
| **Signal** | An observation — concrete data + interpretation |
| **Session** | A bounded interaction or working session |
| **Discrepancy** | A gap between intent and output |
| **Stock** | A measurable accumulation (trust, knowledge, capacity) |

### Relationship Types

26 typed relationships including `PURPOSE`, `CONTAINS`, `FILLS`, `GOVERNS`, `OWNS`, `SERVES`, `SIGNALS`, `SCOPED_TO`, `TRIGGERED_BY`, `AFFECTS`, `GOVERNED_BY`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `FLOWS_TO`, `RUNS_ON`, and more. See `src/types.ts` for the full list.

## The Structured-Intent Model

ESIM's node and relationship types aren't generic — they encode a specific model of how intent is structured. Understanding the model is what makes the graph useful; without it, you just have typed boxes.

The core idea: **intent has structure, and that structure can be made explicit, stored, and diagnosed.** Most intent lives implicitly — in someone's head, scattered across documents, assumed but never stated. Structured intent pulls it into the open as a graph you can reason about.

### The intent frame — six layers

The central object is the **intent frame**: the full configuration of a single entity — a person, team, project, tool, or role. A complete frame answers six questions, cascading from *why* down to *how*. Each layer is expressed by an ESIM primitive you already have, and each is judged a different way:

| Layer | Question it answers | ESIM primitive | Well-formed when… |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **1. Purpose** | Why does it exist? | `PURPOSE` edge (+ `purpose_type`) | it points outward, to who or what it serves |
| **2. Understanding** | What do we understand to be true? | `Constraint` (`understanding`) | the picture is *complete* — no unstated assumptions |
| **3. Priorities** | What wins when things conflict? | `Constraint` (`priority`) | each takes a clear *position* on a real tension |
| **4. Approaches** | How do we go about it? | `Constraint` (`approach`) | the method is *compatible* with the priorities above |
| **5. Composition** | What is it made of? | `CONTAINS` edge (with `order`) | the parts *cohere* — they fit together |
| **6. Mechanics** | What concrete machinery runs it? | `Constraint` (`mechanics`) | it *integrates* with everything above |

The layers **cascade**: purpose shapes what you need to understand, understanding shapes which priorities are in play, priorities shape approaches, and so on down. That's why a problem at the bottom (a tool, a routine) so often traces to something unstated near the top (an unexamined understanding, an undeclared purpose) — and why you diagnose by walking the cascade from the symptom upward.

Two of the six are edges rather than nodes: purpose and composition describe how an entity *relates* — to what it serves, and to its own parts. The other four are `Constraint` nodes, distinguished by `constraint_type`. None of this is a feature you switch on; the six layers are a lens over primitives ESIM already stores.

> **Naming note:** the four constraint layers are stored as `Constraint` nodes with `constraint_type` `understanding`, `priority`, `approach`, or `mechanics`. Purpose and Composition aren't constraint types — they're the `PURPOSE` and `CONTAINS` edges.

### Purpose lives on edges, not in nodes

An entity's purpose isn't a property it holds — it's the set of `PURPOSE` edges pointing from it to what it serves. A person, team, or tool *exists to do something for someone*, and that "for someone" is directional, so it's an edge. An entity with no purpose edges doesn't act with intent — it reacts.

Every `PURPOSE` edge carries a type:

| Purpose type | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| **Create** | New value enters the system |
| **Sustain** | Existing value held against entropy |
| **Transform** | Value changes form through processing |
| **Enable** | Value reaches a destination it couldn't reach alone |

### The intent formula

Structured intent reads every output through one relationship:

```
(Needs + Resources) / Constraints = Output
```

- **Needs** — what is required.
- **Resources** — what is available (skill, knowledge, tool, budget, capacity).
- **Constraints** — what shapes how potential becomes output.
- **Output** — what actually gets produced.

Constraints are the lever. Aligned with purpose, a constraint *multiplies* output (leverage); misaligned, it *consumes* potential (a tax). The formula turns a vague "this isn't working" into a locatable question: *which constraint is taxing the output?*

### Purpose vs. function

**Purpose** is what an entity exists to do (declared). **Function** is what it's actually being used for (observed). Conflating the two is at the root of most misalignment — a butter knife used as a screwdriver partly works, but the knife gets damaged and the screw never seats. ESIM keeps declared purpose and observed function as separate, comparable things; the gap between them is a first-class node (a `Discrepancy`).

### Framing an intent — the workflow

"Intent framing" is the act of building a frame for a specific entity until it's complete and coherent. In ESIM that's a concrete sequence of tool calls:

1. **Create the entity.** `create_entity` an `Agent` (or `Role`) — the thing whose intent you're framing.
2. **Declare purpose.** Wire `PURPOSE` edges from it to what it serves, each with a `purpose_type`. No purpose edge means no intent — just reaction.
3. **Add the four constraint layers.** `create_entity` `Constraint` nodes for Understanding, Priorities, Approaches, and Mechanics (`constraint_type` `understanding`, `priority`, `approach`, `mechanics`); wire them with `GOVERNS`.
4. **Compose it.** If the entity has parts, `create_entity` them and wire `CONTAINS` (with `order`) — that's the composition layer.
5. **Attach needs and resources.** `create_entity` `Need` and `Resource` nodes for what's required and what's available.
6. **Capture evidence as it arrives.** As reality produces observations, `create_signal` to record them against the relevant entity — declared intent on one side, observed signal on the other.
7. **Calibrate.** Compare the declared frame against accumulated signals. Where they diverge, surface a `Discrepancy`. Closing that gap — by updating the frame or changing behavior — is the point of the whole exercise.

Steps 1–5 are *declaration* (what you intend); steps 6–7 are *calibration* (reconciling intent with reality). A frame is never "done" — it gets sharper every time you calibrate.

### Where the skills fit

The [`skills/`](skills/) directory turns this model into guided practice:

- [`purpose-discovery`](skills/purpose-discovery/SKILL.md) — walks a person through building their first frame end to end (steps 1–5).
- [`session-protocol`](skills/session-protocol/SKILL.md) — governs how the assistant captures signals and keeps the graph calibrated during ongoing work (steps 6–7).
- [`signal-processing`](skills/signal-processing/SKILL.md) — systematically processes captured signals into graph updates (the engine behind calibration).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Deno 2+](https://deno.land/)
- Neo4j (cloud or local)
- An OpenAI-compatible API for embeddings and completions

### Quick Start (Docker + OpenAI)

```bash
# Start local Neo4j
docker compose up -d

# Configure environment (recommended: system-wide config directory)
mkdir -p ~/.config/env
cp .env.example ~/.config/env/esim.env
# Edit ~/.config/env/esim.env — uncomment Docker lines, add your OpenAI key

# Initialize schema (creates vector indexes + constraints)
deno task setup

# Register with Claude Code (use absolute path to your clone)
claude mcp add esim -- deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-sys \
  /absolute/path/to/esim/src/main.ts

# Verify
claude mcp list   # should show "esim"
```

### Fully Local Setup (Docker + Ollama)

For a fully self-hosted setup with no external API calls:

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and pull models:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen3-embedding:0.6b   # embeddings — see "Choosing an Embedding Model" below
   ollama pull llama3.2               # metadata extraction / classification
   ```

2. Start Neo4j:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/env
   cp .env.example ~/.config/env/esim.env
   ```
   Edit `~/.config/env/esim.env` — uncomment the Docker and Ollama sections:
   ```env
   NEO4J_DB_CONNECTION_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
   NEO4J_DB_USERNAME=neo4j
   NEO4J_DB_PASSWORD=password
   LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
   LLM_API_KEY=ollama
   LLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL=qwen3-embedding:0.6b
   LLM_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=1024
   LLM_COMPLETION_MODEL=llama3.2
   ```

4. Initialize and register:
   ```bash
   deno task setup
   claude mcp add esim -- deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-sys \
     /absolute/path/to/esim/src/main.ts
   ```

### Cloud Setup (Neo4j Aura + OpenAI/OpenRouter)

1. Create a free [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/) instance
2. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/env
   cp .env.example ~/.config/env/esim.env
   ```
   Edit `~/.config/env/esim.env`:
   ```env
   NEO4J_DB_CONNECTION_URI=neo4j+s://xxxx.databases.neo4j.io
   NEO4J_DB_USERNAME=neo4j
   NEO4J_DB_PASSWORD=your-password
   LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
   LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```
3. Initialize and register:
   ```bash
   deno task setup
   claude mcp add esim -- deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-sys \
     /absolute/path/to/esim/src/main.ts
   ```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `NEO4J_DB_CONNECTION_URI` | — | Yes | Neo4j connection string |
| `NEO4J_DB_USERNAME` | — | Yes | Neo4j username |
| `NEO4J_DB_PASSWORD` | — | Yes | Neo4j password |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | — | Yes | API key for your LLM provider |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | No | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `LLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-small` | No | Embedding model name |
| `LLM_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` | `1536` | No | Must match your embedding model's output |
| `LLM_COMPLETION_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | No | Model for classification and metadata extraction |

Environment is loaded in this order (first found wins):

1. `ESIM_ENV_FILE` environment variable (explicit override — useful for multi-instance setups)
2. `~/.config/env/esim.env` (recommended — works regardless of working directory)
3. `.env` in repo root (fallback for development)

**Important:** `LLM_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` must exactly match your embedding model's output. Common values: `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` (Ollama) = 1024, `nomic-embed-text` (Ollama) = 768, `text-embedding-3-small` (OpenAI) = 1536. If you change models after setup, drop and recreate indexes — see **Choosing an Embedding Model** below.

## Choosing an Embedding Model

Semantic search quality is mostly set by the embedding model, and for ESIM one factor matters more than benchmark scores: **the context window.**

ESIM embeds whole nodes, not short labels — a single node can hold several paragraphs (a signal stores its full reasoning, not just a title). If the model's context window is smaller than the node, it embeds only the beginning and silently drops the rest, quietly degrading search. **Choose a model whose context window comfortably exceeds your longest nodes.** This is why `mxbai-embed-large`, despite strong English recall, is a poor fit here: its 512-token window truncates longer entries.

Dimension count matters much less. An ESIM graph is small — hundreds to low thousands of nodes — so the usual "more dimensions = more storage and slower search" tradeoff is negligible. Use the model's native dimension and move on.

### Options (Ollama / local)

| Model | Native dims | Context | Fit for ESIM |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **`qwen3-embedding:0.6b`** — recommended | 1024 | 32K | Best 2026 local quality, multilingual (100+ languages), context so large no node ever truncates. ~640 MB. |
| `bge-m3` | 1024 | 8K | Proven, multilingual, also emits sparse vectors (a path to hybrid search later). ~1.2 GB. |
| `embeddinggemma` | 768 | 2K | Best quality-per-byte when RAM is tight. ~300 MB. |
| `nomic-embed-text` | 768 | ~2K | Lightweight baseline — fine, but bettered by the above. ~274 MB. |
| `mxbai-embed-large` | 1024 | **512** ⚠️ | Strong English recall, but the 512-token window truncates rich `context` fields — a poor fit for ESIM despite its reputation. |

For OpenAI/cloud, `text-embedding-3-small` (1536) and `text-embedding-3-large` (3072) both have ample context and need no special handling.

### Changing models after setup

Embeddings from different models are **not comparable** — switching models means re-embedding every node, even if the dimension count is identical:

```bash
# 1. Set LLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL + LLM_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS in your env file
# 2. Drop the old vector indexes
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-sys scripts/drop-indexes.ts
# 3. Recreate indexes at the new dimension
deno task setup
# 4. Re-embed every node with the new model
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-sys scripts/reembed.ts
```

> **Note:** `scripts/reembed.ts` only re-embeds nodes whose vector length differs from the configured dimension. If you switch models but keep the same dimension, it won't notice the change — clear the old embeddings first, or change the dimension to force a full re-embed.

## MCP Connection

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add esim -- deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-sys /path/to/esim/src/main.ts
```

Verify: `claude mcp list` should show `esim` as available.

### Claude Desktop

Add to your MCP config (location varies by platform — see Claude Desktop docs):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "esim": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["run", "--allow-net", "--allow-env", "--allow-read", "--allow-sys", "/path/to/esim/src/main.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after editing. ESIM tools appear in the tools menu.

### Antigravity CLI (`agy`)

ESIM is a standard stdio MCP server. You can configure it manually in your user's `mcp_config.json` file.

**Manual Configuration:**
Add the following `esim` entry under the `mcpServers` object in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "esim": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--allow-net",
        "--allow-env",
        "--allow-read",
        "--allow-sys",
        "/absolute/path/to/esim/src/main.ts"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can manage and inspect MCP servers interactively within `agy` by running the CLI and using the `/mcp` command.

Verify the connection:
1. Start `agy`.
2. Type `/mcp` and press Enter to ensure `esim` is listed and connected.

### Verifying the Connection

Once registered, test from your client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or Antigravity CLI) by asking it to run `stats`. You should get back node/edge counts (all zeros on a fresh install). If you get a connection error, see Troubleshooting below.

| `content` | string | Yes | The content to capture — any text |
| `hints` | object | No | `{ node_type?: string, name?: string }` — guide or skip classification |

```json
// Minimal — let the classifier decide the type
{ "content": "We need to migrate the auth service to OAuth 2.1 before Q3" }

// With hints — skip classification
{ "content": "Kurt is the engineering manager for the platform team", "hints": { "node_type": "Agent", "name": "Kurt" } }
```

## Security & Privacy

**ESIM is designed for local, single-user environments.** It runs as a stdio MCP server — the AI client and ESIM communicate over standard input/output on your local machine. There is no network authentication layer.

Do not expose ESIM over a network without adding your own authentication. Anyone with access to the MCP transport can read and write all data in the graph.

**Data flow awareness:**
- By default, node content is sent to your configured LLM API (OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.) for embedding generation and metadata extraction.
- If you need zero external data sharing, use the fully local setup with Ollama — all processing stays on your machine.
- All graph data is stored in your Neo4j instance. You are responsible for securing it.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  main.ts        — Entry point
  server.ts      — MCP tool registrations
  db.ts          — Neo4j connection and query runner
  queries.ts     — Cypher query builders
  types.ts       — TypeScript types and constants
  llm.ts         — LLM integration (embeddings + metadata)
  classify.ts    — Content classification
  context.ts     — Context reconstruction
  env.ts         — Environment variable loading
  schema.ts      — Schema setup script
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Missing NEO4J_DB_CONNECTION_URI"** — Environment file not found. Check that `~/.config/env/esim.env` exists, or set `ESIM_ENV_FILE` explicitly:
```bash
ESIM_ENV_FILE=/path/to/your/.env deno task setup
```

**"Neo4j connection failed"** — Docker not running or wrong URI. Verify Neo4j is up:
```bash
docker compose ps          # should show neo4j running
docker compose up -d       # restart if needed
```

**"Embedding request failed (401)"** — Invalid `LLM_API_KEY` or wrong `LLM_BASE_URL`. Verify your API credentials with your provider.

**"Vector index created with wrong dimensions"** — `LLM_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` doesn't match your model. Drop and recreate:
```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-sys scripts/drop-indexes.ts
deno task setup
```

**Claude Code doesn't see ESIM tools** — Re-register and verify:
```bash
claude mcp remove esim
claude mcp add esim -- deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-sys /absolute/path/to/esim/src/main.ts
claude mcp list
```

## Skills

ESIM ships with [Agent Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills) in [`skills/`](skills/) that turn the raw graph into a guided, structured-intent practice. They use the standard format, so they run in both [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and the [Antigravity CLI (`agy`)](https://antigravity.google):

- **[`purpose-discovery`](skills/purpose-discovery/SKILL.md)** — facilitates a first structured-intent session: discover an entity's core purpose, constraint stack, and foundational graph.
- **[`session-protocol`](skills/session-protocol/SKILL.md)** — an operating protocol that governs how the assistant loads context, captures signals, and keeps the graph synchronized during any ESIM session.
- **[`signal-processing`](skills/signal-processing/SKILL.md)** — processes captured signals into graph-state updates so the graph stays coherent and complete.

See [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for how to load them.
